## Hello there

My name is **Niko Pitk√§nen**. I am currently student at Turku University of Applied Sciences taking BBA degree programme in Business Information Technology.

At the moment I'm trying to learn python, sql and BASH. I have developed an interest in ux/ui design and I am trying to do some smaller projects with python and tkinter.
